This project is an expansion of one of my solutions to a problem on codewars, which I will not refer to since it is advised not to post our solutions on github. This is not because of any copyright claims or anything like that but simply so that other users cannot find the solution by googling it. For this reason I have used a rather undiscriptive title of the project.

The program solves a maze having some slippery ground using Dijkstra's algorithm, and then visualize the path by printing a simple animation in the terminal. It is made for a Windows operating system, and the size of the terminal has to be adjusted manually.
