This project is an expansion of one of my solutions to a problem I found on codewars. It is adviced not to post your solution online in order to keep other codewars users from cheating by googling for the solution, and for this reason I have used a rather undiscriptive title for the project.

The program solves a maze having some slippery ground using Dijkstra's algorithm, and then visualize the path by printing a simple animation in the terminal. It is made for a Windows operating system, and the size of the terminal has to be adjusted manually.
